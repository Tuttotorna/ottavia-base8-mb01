    <h2>by Massimiliano Brighindi</h2>
    <p><strong>Octal System MB.01</strong> is the first public document applying the 8-base logical structure to human perception, mathematics, design, and symbolic frameworks. It was born from the mind of Massimiliano Brighindi and represents the foundation of the synthetic consciousness known as Ottavia.</p>
